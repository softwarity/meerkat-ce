// Package ui carries the production build of the admin console, embedded in
// the binary by `make ui`. A dist/ holding only its .gitkeep means "this binary
// ships no console" - plain `go build` keeps working without Node - and the
// admin port then answers with its JSON status page instead.
//
// The console is served in ENGLISH only, and that is a decision rather than a
// gap: it is an operator's tool, and twenty-one copies of the same SPA weighed
// 120 MB in the binary for an audience that reads the API's vocabulary anyway.
// The DATA plane - the pages the application's own users see - stays
// translated, and that is where the languages matter.
