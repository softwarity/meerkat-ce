// someone is in - tenants, roles - stays the application's.
//
// The accounts held HERE are in that same list (AUTH-24, kind "local"): one
// screen answers "by which door does one come in", and closing the local
// password is disabling that entry, like any other. It is seeded, unique and
// never deleted - and it never governs the ADMIN plane, which always keeps its
// password sign-in so a broken authority stays repairable. Disabling every
// authority is allowed: it means nobody signs in to the DATA plane, which is a
// legitimate state for a gateway serving public routes only.
