// The mail relay (AUTH-20) is INFRASTRUCTURE: a third-party service reached by
// host and port, with credentials. It belongs to the infra plane for the same
// reason a route's upstream does, and an app admin has no business holding a
// relay's password just to word an account e-mail.
//
// The sender ADDRESS lives here too, because it is not really a free choice: a
// provider refuses (or rewrites) a MAIL FROM that is not the account it just
// authenticated, so the address travels with the credentials. What the product
// does choose is the display NAME in front of it, and that stays with the
// application (see settingsPayload.SMTP).
