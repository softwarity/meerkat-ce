// Package idp drives the external authorities a person may sign in with
// (AUTH-19): OIDC today, LDAP and SAML behind the same contract.
//
// Two families, because the protocols really do differ:
//
//   - Redirect authorities (OIDC, SAML) send the browser away and answer on a
//     callback. Meerkat never sees the credentials.
//   - Credential authorities (LDAP) are asked directly, with the username and
//     password the person typed on our own form.
//
// Everything here is about ESTABLISHING who the person is. What happens next -
// linking to a local account, creating a pending one, granting roles - belongs
// to internal/auth, because it is the same story as self-registration.
