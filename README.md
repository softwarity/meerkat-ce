# Meerkat

> The sentinel at your application's door.

**Meerkat** is an **app-gateway**: the single entry point for enterprise internal
applications. Unlike a classic API gateway, it is built to *serve an application* - it takes
care of everything that is common to all your services and none of your team's core business:

- **Authentication** - login pages served by the gateway, passwordless first (passkeys,
  TOTP, email OTP), enterprise methods (OIDC, LDAP, SAML) limited to authentication only
- **Authorization** - roles, role groups, per-route and per-endpoint access control
- **Multi-tenancy** - organizations, members, groups, tenant switching
- **Routing** - dynamic routes over a service catalog discovered in your cluster, hot reload,
  versioned configurations (duplicate, diff, switch, rollback)
- **Built-in, no extra tooling** - API quotas, audit log, observability dashboards: in the
  console, not in a YAML file, with no Prometheus/Grafana required
- **Dev mode** - with [`softwarity/plug`](https://github.com/softwarity/plug), a developer's
  workstation joins the cluster: their local service substitutes the deployed one for their
  own traffic, and testers can opt in to try a dev's variant
- **Zero dependency** - a single binary with embedded storage; an external database only if
  you want a HA cluster

Your services stay lean: they receive requests already authenticated, carrying a signed JWT
with identity, roles and tenant.

Meerkat is the successor of [Archway](https://github.com/softwarity/archway), rebuilt from
the ground up, and is edited by **[Softwarity](https://softwarity.io)**.

## Status

🚧 **Under construction, and running.** What the gateway does today, what is half-built and
what is not started are one table in [FEATURES.md](./FEATURES.md) (French), with the state
read from the code rather than from a plan.

## Why "Meerkat"?

The meerkat is nature's sentinel: it stands guard at the burrow entrance and raises the
alert, so the rest of the colony can work without worrying about anything. That is exactly
what this gateway does for your services. Even the `plug` tunnel fits the picture - it is how
a developer's machine digs its way into the burrow. And since a group of meerkats is called a
*mob*, you already know what to call a cluster of Meerkat nodes.

## Development

Two terminals. Node version is pinned by `.node-version` (fnm/nvm switch automatically);
Go toolchain resolves from `go.mod`.

```bash
# terminal 1 - the console (:4200)
cd console
npm install            # once, and after every pull that touches console/package.json
npm start              # ng serve

# terminal 2 - the gateway, hot-reloaded on every .go save (air)
MEERKAT_ADDR=:8082 \
MEERKAT_ADMIN_ADDR=:9092 \
MEERKAT_CONSOLE_URL=http://localhost:4200 \
MEERKAT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=test1234 \
make dev               # requires air: go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

`make dev` builds the **Enterprise image** (the `ee` build tag, set in
`.air.toml`): what is being built lives under `ee/` too, and a feature nobody can
see is a feature nobody tests. The startup line says which edition came up. Use
**`make dev-ce`** for the same loop as a community install sees it: no
multi-organisation, no directories, no page arrangements - that code is not in
the binary at all.

Then browse **http://localhost:9092** (the admin port): the gateway serves its API and
login there and proxies everything else to the console dev server, HMR included. Pick
any free ports; if a bind fails (port already in use) the process exits - the `fatal`
line at the top of the log tells you which one.

The console is **English only** - it is an operator's tool, and its vocabulary is the
API's. The pages the application's own users meet (sign-in, MFA, the user button) are
the translated ones, and that pool is the integrator's to declare.

`make build && ./bin/meerkat --help` lists every flag; each has a `MEERKAT_*` env
equivalent. First start seeds the `admin` account (password printed once unless
`MEERKAT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set) - wipe `data/` to start fresh.

A release build ships the console **inside the binary**: `make ui && make build`.
The binary then serves the console itself on the admin port (`/` redirects to your
browser's language, `/en/...`, `/fr/...`) - no Node at runtime, which is also how the
Docker image is built. `--console-url` stays the dev override and always wins over
the embedded build; without either, the admin port answers a JSON status page.
